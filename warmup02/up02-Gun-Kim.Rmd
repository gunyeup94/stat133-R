## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
  #download data
  url = paste0('https://github.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-hws-fall17/', 'raw/master/warmup02/data/nba2017-salary-points.RData')
destfile = "nba2017-salary-points.RData"
load("nba2017-salary-points.RData")
```

```{r}
  #evaluating points
  summary(points)
  hist(points)
  boxplot(points)
```
```{r}
  plot(density(points))
  #adding a Normal Curve
  x <- points
  xfit <- seq(min(x), max(x), length = 2500)
  yfit <- dnorm(xfit, mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x))
  plot(density(yfit))
```
