		Data preparation, and reformatting
		Data analysis and visualization
		reporting via interactive tools

	3. Practice with R packages:
		"testthat"
		"shiny"
		"ggvis"
		optional: "readr", "dplyr", etc

```{R
library(shiny)

# Run an app from a subdirectory in the repo
runGitHub("stat133-hws-fall17", gunyeup94, subdir = "hw04/app")
